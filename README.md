## Scope
Build a web page to search for and list employees.

## Motivation
Cardinal-Employee-Directory is a project designed to search a directory of fictitious employees and render the results. Cardinal financial is looking for a mix of well written code, modern design traits, and a pleasing and enjoyable user experience that performs across multiple platforms and devices.

## Search
A search input provides the ability to find a person by their name, at minimum, but
other fields could also be searchable.

## Results
People who match the inputted search criteria should be listed on a results page/view, which should include their name, job title, department, and headshot.
Results should be filterable by at least one data point; for example, by department or state, etc.

## Detail
Clicking on an employee should provide further details about that employee. This could be in a view (hiding and showing sections of the current page), modal dialog,
or new page (listed in order of complexity). The employee details can contain any part of the data for that employee. Some of the data may be more complicated to
add than others. Feel free to get creative!
